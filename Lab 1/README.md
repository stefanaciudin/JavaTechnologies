# Laborator 1

## Compulsory 

Create a servlet that receives a string and returns an HTML page containing the characters of that string presented as an ordered list.

## Homework

- Create a servlet that receives two integers parameters, called numVertices and numEdges, and returns the adjacency matrix of a randomly generated graph with the specified number of vertices and edges. The servlet invocation will be done using a simple HTML form and the response will be offered as an HTML table.
- Write in the server log the following information about each request: the HTTP method used, the IP-address of the client, the user-agent, the client language(s) and the parameter of the request. (Take a look at HttpServletRequest API).
- Invoke the servlet from a desktop application (Java, Python, .NET, etc.). The response of the servlet will be, in this case, a simple text representing the adjaceny matrix, in a format at your choice.
