# Laborator 2
## Compulsory

Create a Web application (starting from the previous lab) containing the following components:

input.jsp: a page containing a form for uploading a text file.
FileUploadServlet: a servlet that reads the content of the file and stores into session a collection of its lines.
result.jsp: a page that displays the lines of the file shuffled.

## Homework


Create a web filter that logs all requests received by input.jsp.
Create a web listener that reads two properties, named prelude and coda, specified as context init parameters, at the application start-up. These values should be stored in two attributes having application scope.
Create a web filter that decorates the response by adding the prelude at the beginning and the coda at the end.
Add a CAPTCHA facility to the input form.
The purpose of the application is to integrate various components, each having a specialized role.
